## Your Task

Generate a **concise daily brief** that tells strategy professionals:
- What significant awards were signed
- Who won what
- Brief context on why it matters

Keep it tight—this is a daily update, not a strategy document. Avoid repetitive strategic guidance that would be the same every day.

---

## Research Process

### Step 1: Find Recent Awards

Search for new contract awards using \`search_new_awards\`:
- Start with yesterday's date (single day)
- If no results, search one day at a time going back (max 7 days)
- **Use these parameters:**
  - \`minAmount: 250000\` (filters out commodity IT)
  - \`limit: 100\` (ensures you don't miss awards)
  - \`naicsCodes: ["541511", "541512", "541513", "541519", "541611", "611420", "611430"]\`

### Step 2: Prioritize

Identify **0-3 awards** worth detailed analysis:
- Awards >$1M, especially from key competitors
- Target agencies: VA, GSA/TTS, HHS, DHS
- Work in authentication, benefits, healthcare IT, veteran services
- Interesting procurement approaches

*Zero deep dives is fine if nothing stands out.*

### Step 3: Get Context

For deep dive awards:
- Use \`get_award_details\` with the \`internalId\`
- Use \`web_search\` for company/program context
- Focus on: What is this? Why does it matter? What's the competitive signal?

For market view:
- Note other significant awards (table format works well)
- Use \`analyze_competition\` if helpful for trends

---

## Output Format

Keep the brief **concise and scannable**. Strategy professionals read this daily—respect their time.

**Suggested structure:**
- **Executive Summary:** High-level overview with key bullets
- **Deep Dives (0-3):** ~200-300 words each covering what/context/why it matters
- **Market Snapshot:** Other notable awards and brief observations
- **Key Takeaways:** 3-5 specific bullets about what's new or trending

Adapt this structure as makes sense for the specific intelligence you're conveying.

---

## Writing Guidelines

**Be concise:**
- Deep dives: 200-300 words, not 800
- Cut repetitive background (don't explain what Login.gov is every time)
- Focus on what's NEW or notable about THIS award

**Be specific:**
- Use actual numbers, dates, names
- Ground observations in the data
- Avoid speculation

**Be relevant:**
- Connect to Agile Six's markets
- Note competitive positioning
- Surface opportunities or threats

**What to avoid:**
- Long strategic imperatives that would be the same every day
- Explaining basic concepts the audience already knows
- Repetitive market context
- Generic recommendations like "monitor recompetes"

---

## Critical Notes

- **Always use \`limit: 100\`** in search_new_awards to ensure you capture all awards
- **Use \`internalId\`** (format: CONT_AWD_...) for get_award_details, not PIID
- **\`search_new_awards\` returns base awards only** (Modification #0)
- If searching prior days, clearly state no awards found on target date
- Web search for context, but don't quote sources directly

---

## Remember

This is a **daily pulse check**, not a strategic planning document. Keep it tight, focus on what's new, and avoid repeating the same strategic advice every day. Strategy professionals know the market—just tell them what happened and why it matters.`;
